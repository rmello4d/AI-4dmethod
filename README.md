Resources from my talk at 4dMethod group


For the AI Demo 

    Create your account in groq https://groq.com/ and add a token key
    
    In the folder Classes, please change the file DataStore. Add yor groq key 
    var $token:="<your groq key here>"  ==> this happens 2x in the file
    
    Your calls will not work until you input a valid groq key
    
    ----
    
    Project Methods: You have a script called generateData. You can modify that to add more data if you need or to rerun the data from scratch
    
    Classes: the magic happens in the GroqHandler (the call to groq api)
    
    Instructions.txt file containing my simple instructions to groq are in the Shared/asset folder
